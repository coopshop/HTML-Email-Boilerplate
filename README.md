# HTML-Email-Boilerplate
An open to use boilerplate for tackling those nasty emails.

# Usage Guide

### Beginnings
HTML Emails should be built entirely within a table. The boilerplate already has the structure set to start adding content inside of the first `<td>`. The coding guide follows which includes snippets that I'll explain below.

#### WIDTH:
As a best practice, the width of an email shouldn't exceed 600px. That is the maximum width of most email preview panes.

#### PARAGRAPHS & TEXT:
Do not use `<p>`, instead put everything directly in `<font>`. `<p>` doesn't render consistently, especially with padding and margins, and are a pain to fix. Style 'line-height' inside `<td>` because it will not work in `<font>`.

#### EMPHASIS:
Avoid using `<em>`, `<strong>`, or `font-weight:bold`, stick with `<b>` and `<i>`.

#### ALSO AVOID USING:
`<div>`, `<span>`, `<em>`, `<li>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<sup>`, `<sub>`. Many of them have preset styles that are very difficult to remove across the board. The coding guide shows good alternatives for superscripts and subscripts using `<font>`.

#### TABLES WITHIN TABLES:
For static tables adjust the desired size of the containers in the `<td>`, for responsive also add `width="100%"` to the parent `<table>`. Always continue to put tables within tables until `colspan` and `rowspan` are not needed.

#### SPACERS and PARAGRAPH SPACING:
When possible, avoid using `<br />` between paragraph blocks, images, `padding`, `margin`, and text as spacing elements, etc. ONLY USE `<br />`: when it's needed to return a line of text based on vendor's art for consistency. Add the provided code to make a new empty cell and adjust the height accordingly.

#### INSERTING IMAGES:
The width and height must be declared for all images and border must remain at 0. Add `class="image-responsive"` if desired to make the image responsive on mobile. I always export my images as PNGs and then run them through [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) to compress and when necessary, preserve the transparency. In some Microsoft email clients, an image must be at least 10px high or else it will not render properly. 

#### BULLETS: 
Do NOT put the bullet/number in the same `<td>` as the corresponding text. Follow the provided code, adjusting the color, font-size, and line-height. Line-height must remain consistent. The width of the bullet can also be adjusted to change the spacing. If a bulleted list is one line of text long, add`valign="top"` to the second `<td>` so that it aligns with the bullet.

#### METRICS:
Only use px and % for sizes for height, width, fonts, etc. In some clients em, and rem will not render correctly. **IMPORTANT:** Anytime you have a value of 0 DO NOT include any metric afterwards. DO NOT use pm inside HTML attributes such as width and height, but you must use % if you want a percent value. Avoid shorthands like `#fff;` and `white;`. Shorthand don't always work so it's best to keep it consistent with `#ffffff`. Also avoid `padding: 5px 10px;`, padding must have all 4 values present.

#### HIDING ON DESKTOP/SHOW ON MOBILE (responsive only):
Due to differences between email clients put the content inside `<div>` first. This should be the one and only time to use a `<div>` inside an HTML email. Avoid styling the parent `<td>` because that will still show. 

#### STACKING CELLS (responsive only):
To have a left and right column stack and be 100% on mobile, give the parent table `class="container"` and the child `<td>` `class="column-container"`. Note: currently in Android 4.4, this does not work. You must change the child `<td>` to `<th>` and declare inline `style:font-weight:normal;"`. This has been resolved in later versions of Android.

#### HTML EMAIL-SAFE FONTS:
Remember to pick web-safe fonts and double check with the vendor/graphic artist if they choose a font outside this list:

Type| Families
--- | --- 
Sans Serif|Arial, Arial Black, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Verdana
Serif|Courier, Courier New, Georgia, Times, Times New Roman

#### SPECIAL CHARACTERS:
Symbol|Code
--- | --- 
&lsquo;|`&lsquo;`
&rsquo; | `&rsquo;`
&ldquo; | `&ldquo;`
&rdquo; | `&rdquo;`
&mdash; | `&mdash;`
&ndash; | `&ndash;`
&reg; | `&reg;`
&copy; | `&copy;`
&trade; | `&trade;`
&gt; | `&gt;`
&ge; | `&ge;`
&lt; | `&lt;`
&le; | `&le;`
non-breaking space | `&nbsp;`
non-breaking hyphen | `&#8209;`
zero width joiner | `&zwj;`
zero width non joiner | `&zwnj;`

#### MISCELLANEOUS/TIPS:
- Anchor tags should be avoided, support was dropped for them in iOS 8
- Add a zero width non jointer inside phone numbers and address to prevent them from autolinking in GMAIL and iOS.
- Test emails in real life outside of Litmus
- For responsive classes makes sure to add `class=""` as the last attribute in the tag
