# HTML-Email-Boilerplate
An open to use boilerplate for tackling those nasty emails.

# Usage Guide
#### WIDTH:
As a best practice, the width of an email shouldn't exceed 600px.  That is the maximum width of most email preview panes.

#### PARAGRAPHS & TEXT:
Do not use `<p>`, instead put everything directly in `<font>`. `<p>` doesn't render consistently, especially with padding and margins, and are a pain to fix. Style 'line-height' inside `<td>` because it will not work in `<font>`.

#### EMPHASIS:
Avoid using `<em>`, `<strong>`, or `font-weight:bold`, stick with `<b>` and `<i>`.

#### ALSO AVOID USING:
`<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<em>`, `<li>`, `<h1>-<h6>`, `<sup>`, `<sub>`. Many of them have preset styles that are very difficult to remove across the board. In the code you will fine good alternatives for superscripts and subscripts.

#### TABLES WITHIN TABLES:
For static tables adjust the desired size of the containers in the `<td>`, for responsive also add `width="100%" to `table`.

#### SPACERS and PARAGRAPH SPACING:
When possible, avoid using `<br />` tags between paragraph blocks, images and text, as spacing elements, etc. ONLY USE: when you need to return a line of text based on vendor's art for consistency. Add the provided code and adjust the height accordingly.

#### INSERTING IMAGES:
You must declare the width and height size for all images and border must remain at 0. Add `class="image-responsive"` if desired to make the image responsive on mobile.

#### BULLETS: 
Do NOT put the bullet/number in the same `<td>` as the corresponding text. Follow the provided code, adjusting the color, font-size, and line-height. Line-height must remain consistant. The width of the bullet can also be adjusted to change the spacing. If your bulleted list is one line of text, add`valign="top"` to the second `<td>`.

#### METRICS:
Only use px and % for sizes for height, width, fonts, etc. In some clients em, and rem will not render correctly. **IMPORTANT:** Anytime you have a value of 0 DO NOT include any metric afterwards. DO NOT use PX inside html attributes such as width and height, but you must use % if you want a percent value. Avoid shorthands like '#fff' and "white". Shorthand doesn't always work so it's best to keep it consistant with `#ffffff`. Also avoid `padding: 5px 10px;`, padding must have all 4 values present.

#### HIDING ON DESKTOP/SHOW ON MOBILE (responsive only):
GMAIL is the biggest pain in the butt when it comes to show and hide. Because of this we need to put the content inside `<div>`. This should be the one and only time you use a `<div>` inside an HTML email. Since we want to avoid anything obsuring the view on desktop avoid styling the parent `<td>`.

#### HTML EMAIL-SAFE FONTS:
Remember to pick web-safe fonts and double check with the vendor/graphic artist if they chose a font outside this list:

Type| Families
--- | --- 
Sans Serif:|Arial, Arial Black, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Verdana
Serif:|Courier, Courier New, Georgia, Times, Times New Roman

#### SPECIAL CHARACTERS:
Symbol|Code
--- | --- 
&lsquo;|`&lsquo;`
&rsquo; | `&rsquo;`
&ldquo; | `&ldquo;`
&rdquo; | `&rdquo;`
&mdash; | `&mdash;`
&ndash; | `&ndash;`
&reg; | `&reg;`
&copy; | `&copy;`
&trade; | `&trade;`
&gt; | `&gt;`
&ge; | `&ge;`
&lt; | `&lt;`
&le; | `&le;`
non-breaking space | `&nbsp;`
non-breaking hyphen | `&#8209;`
zero width joiner | `&zwnj;`
